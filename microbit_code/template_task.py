def task():
    """
    Your code goes inside this function, which MUST be called task. DO NOT change the name of this function.
    Feel free to add any function definitions, import statements or any other valid MicroPython, as long as everything can happen inside this one function.
    Assume that nothing is imported - including the microbit library. Import everything you need.
    Try to keep your tasks as short as possible - radio bandwidth is limited and we want a nice fast cluster!
