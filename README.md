# cluster:bit
## Python clustering software for the BBC micro:bit
cluster:bit is a Python-based clustering system for the BBC micro:bit, currently being developed by tramcrazy. Eventually, there should be a nice web dashboard to upload tasks, monitor micro:bits, and view results.
The current roadmap for development is:
- Ensure results from program execution on a USB-connected micro:bit can be displayed on the host computer.
- Implement radio functionality to connect more than one micro:bit to the cluster system.
- Implement simultaneous task execution on multiple micro:bits.
- Create a web-based GUI for the system and a Flask backend.
